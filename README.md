```
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Frameworks, Technologies, and Utitlies ###
 - Basic [HTML canvas element](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/canvas_intro.asp) to draw graphics.
 - [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) for data manipulation in JavaScript; useEffect, useRef, and useState specifically.
 - [JSS](https://cssinjs.org/) for basic styling; which doesn't really exist for the Minimum Viable Product.
 - [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) for Grid styling.
 - [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for bundling the application.
 - [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for compiling the JavaScript.
